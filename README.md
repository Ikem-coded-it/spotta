## DOCUMENTATION

- I'm making use of the nextjs app router therefore all page files are located within the `app` folder.
- Besides page folders, the `app` folder contains two more important folder
1) **lib folder**: This contains utils, type definitions and storage folder for static data used in the app.
2) **ui folder**: This stores special components according to different pages where they are used. It also contains one `component` folder used for storing common components used throughout the app, like a button for example.
